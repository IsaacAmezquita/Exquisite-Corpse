When they had first offered the contract, he’d almost walked away immediately. The money was good. So good in fact that it had set alarm bells ringing.

“What’s the catch?” he’d asked, idly stroking the handle of the knife worn at his waist. His gun he’d had to leave at the door but like most in the Outer Rim, they barely considered a blade a weapon. Which is why he always carried one.

“No catch,” the broker responded. “Simple live grab job. We have the co-ordinates, low level security planet. And target is a criminal, so the local law shouldn’t get in the way.”

He’d sent his thoughts out then, a questing cloud of consciousness that descended on the broker’s mind. It was convoluted, a rapidly fluttering mess of images and emotions that were common to his insectoid species. There was no sign of falsehood though but deep down, buried beneath his professionalism was a kernel of confusion that was familiar.

“Then why exactly are they offering this much?” The bounty hunter asked finally, reigning his thoughts back in like a shepherd recalling his herd. “It’s not a fortune but you and I both know its well above the average rate.”

The broker sighed in a chittering of mandibles, twitching antennae that drooped slightly.

“The target is human.”

There was a long moment of silence, punctuated only by the shuffling feet of the guard at the door. The hunter stared at the broker’s segmented eyes but while his mind was open to him, his features were a complete stone wall.

“And? The mammalian bipeds? Have they developed venomous fangs? Some new weapon? Their own form of telepathy?”

The mention of the latter caused the broker to flinch slightly, as if remembering for the first time that the alien before him was an Animo and so had access to that himself. The bounty hunter cursed internally and leaned forward, picking up the data slate.

“So just a human criminal? Capture him and bring him to the buyer? That’s it?”

“That’s it,” the broker agreed, resting his pincers on the table in front of him, more relaxed now he could sense the deal was nearly done. “And for a very tidy sum.”

The bounty hunter stood to his full spindly height, his spine crested head almost brushing the ceiling of the office.

“Then consider it done.”

………….

It hadn’t taken long to track down the human. The part of the world it hid on was a sprawling metropolis, its skies heavy and dark with the belching fumes from its myriad of factories. It was a mess of a place, with alleys and walkways crisscrossing across the city to no real plan or design. The hardest part was actually finding the creature in that sprawl and he’d essentially got lucky by staking out the cheapest bars around. The actual capture of the human however, was easy. The gas took effect quicker than it did for most sentient species and as the target crumpled to the floor, he’d idly wondered if it had been used on their kind before. He hoped it wouldn’t cause too many adverse effects. That lowered the price.

It was stowed now on the ship, manacled to a back wall by all four of its limbs. He’d had to dig out the smallest constraints he had and even those seemed worryingly loose. He’d contemplated finding some additional measure of securing the cargo but looking at it, pale and small on the metal floor, he hadn’t bothered. The gun it carried was an old make he couldn’t identify and he’d thrown it into the first trash chute he’d found. What had surprised him was the human carried a blade as well, a long, thin thing with a well-worn handle. That he kept and it sat now on his dashboard, occasionally catching his attention as he checked the ship’s systems.

It was a dull flight to the warp gate and he picked up the knife again, studying it more closely with his four black eyes. It was serviceable if unadorned and unlike most of what he had found on the human, it had clearly been cared for. He balanced it on his long fingers, admiring the balance. It was too small for him to wield properly but it may have use as a throwing weapon. He flicked it up in the air swiftly, gripping it delicately by the tip before launching it expertly across the cockpit to embed in a wooden board he’d hung up, its surface already pitted and scarred. His colleagues, even those who were Animo, thought his enjoyment of such things archaic and unbecoming. He stood to retrieve the weapon when he suddenly felt something, a flutter like the displaced air from a bird’s wing. Only this vibration wasn’t felt on the physical plane but through the aether that hung all around, invisible from most eyes. The human was awake.

He moved to the doorway and glanced down the corridor, to where he could see the human hanging suspended on the wall. It was a small ship so he had gagged the target rather than listen to it babble in its grunting language but he could see it was clearly growling something none the less. He stared at it, the first one he’d actually seen in person and found himself disappointed. Given the amount of bounty offered, he’d hoped there was something about the creature he’d missed at first glance. But as it hung there, struggling consistently against the restraints, it was revealed as just a thin thing encased in soft skin that offered little protection against the hazards the Rim offered. As an Animo, the hunter was aware more than most that looks can be deceiving however and so he sent forth his wave of thought towards the human, to probe at its mind. He’d expected something primitive but what his consciousness encountered surprised even him – almost a nothingness, a blank pulsation that began to give him a headache after a few moments. He recalled his mind, nonplussed at such a bizarre sensation and after a second’s more hesitation, turned back to slide into his seat in the cockpit.

“Nothing,” he muttered to himself, flicking a dial idly to ascertain how far they had left to go. “Is it even sentient? Are they all like this? Maybe it’s broken. A lot of money for a broken one.”

He stretched out in his seat, switching on an overhead monitor which began to list contracts available and their fees. He scrolled for a few moments before selecting one, a kill order on a Veneen diplomat, and a wall of text appeared. A few minutes passed, his head in his hands, before the hunter realised that he had read the same line three times. He shook his head, his spines rattling quietly. There was something bothering him about the human and after a moment, he dispersed his consciousness once more, to swarm around its exotic, seemingly guarded brain and draw what secrets it could. He was hit by the same as before, that throbbing wall that was enveloping, pushing towards him like an eager beast. He was about to pull back once more when he finally placed what it was, not nothingness but an emotion. Anger.

The human was projecting nothing but an all-encompassing fury, a white hot hate that obliterated all thought behind it, or at least all that the Animo could reach. It was startling, something he hadn’t experienced in his many years, such a raw outpouring. After a moment he realised that something about it was familiar, something long buried, from when he was no more than a youngling. He and his friends, in an effort to stave off the crushing boredom that came from living on their backwater planet, had found a wild Breg in a cave. It was a malnourished thing but still bared sharp fangs, the spines on its back raising in challenge as they’d approached. They stared at it for a long time, as it screeched a warning at them but made no move to attack. Eventually one of his friends had bent down and picked up a rock, flinging it at the Breg which caught it near one eye in a smattering of black blood. Almost as one, unconsciously, the four of them all gathered their own rocks and threw them at the beast, laughing in that slightly hysterical way of children knowing they are doing something wrong. The stones battered the Breg’s body, sending it crashing to the ground as one well aimed missile struck and shattered a leg. It still screamed at them while it writhed and before he could think twice, the hunter had sent his consciousness over to the beast, to envelop its thoughts. What he had found caused him to turn and leave his friends behind, ignoring their shouts and insults, running back through the forest so fast that branches whipped at his face leaving painful welts. He ran blind, his young mind still consumed with that raw wall of bestial anger that had besieged him, the fury the Breg had felt as they’d stoned it to death.

“No better than animals then,” he muttered to himself, shifting in his seat. “Or smart enough to try and hide its thoughts from me.”

It was possible to resist an Animo’s invasive mind, some species having greater luck than others. Diplomats and spies going onto an Animo world were trained in it, in whatever method their species preferred. Most simply held one thing in their thoughts, focusing on it while allowing subconscious thoughts to flow hidden behind. Others, like the broker’s race, preferred to project a confusing cacophony of thoughts, images and sounds. This was commonly referred to as defending or attacking a mental probe. Others though, especially those with little training, were told to try and focus on an emotion, stoke and inflame it to such levels that it obliterated any thoughts the Animo tried to reveal. As he pondered on the relative newness of the human’s to their shared Galactic space however, he thought it unlikely that they would know this or even know of the Animo’s peculiar advancement. So was it simply blasting anger and hate? Consumed in a maelstrom of furious passion at being imprisoned?

“20,000 for transporting a beast,” the bounty hunter chuckled but it pealed out quickly and silence returned to the ship, save for the muffled sounds of the human still struggling at its bonds.

They were not far from the gate at this point and he answered the hail from the station situated near it, confirming his licence and destination. While his fingers flicked over the controls, his body unconsciously sending the data as it had done hundreds of times before, he was uncomfortably aware for the first time that the human was just a short corridor behind him. He could almost feel its eyes searing into the back of his spines, those bloodshot pale orbs now seeming sinister rather than laughable knowing what lay behind them. He shrugged his shoulders reflexively, his spines rattling on his head. He growled in annoyance, at allowing some backwater alien get his hackles up but couldn’t bring himself to turn around and look down that passageway, to where he knew it was staring up at him. He wondered if they possessed some form of mental ability of their own, one that was causing his back to prickle and a warm, damp sweat to trickle within his heavy suit. He finished the necessary protocols for the gate station and sat there, staring at the various instruments and dials but not seeing them. He glanced at the weapon he had taken, still rooted in the wooden panel, which now seemed like such an infantile archaism that he stood quickly, striding to wrench it free. He threw the small weapon to the side with a loud rattle as it skidded across the floor. He reached a hand up to his face, rubbing the rough scales across his chin and forcing a professional calm as best he could. He turned to sit back down before pausing and moving towards the doorway. He’d gas the damn thing again, put it to sleep until he could get rid of it and absorb the penalty if it never woke up.

He stepped into the corridor, lit by the same stark lights that emanated throughout his ship but paused when he properly saw the human again. It was staring at him, as he’d expected, but something was different, a glimmer of more behind those tiny orbs. He sent out his conscious on reflex, as natural as breathing for an Animo, but it had just touched the being when he saw what was different. Only one of its slender limbs was held up, clamped by its head. To the left hung an empty manacle and the arm it had contained was scrabbling at one still bound. The escaped limb was raw, covered in a vivid pulsing red, and the restraint it had escaped held scraps of flesh and skin that sent a wave of revulsion through his body. The wounded arm did not seem to slow the creature and it tore into its own appendage until eventually it managed to slide that brutalised limb free as well.

The bounty hunter quickly retracted his consciousness, not wanting to know what lay behind those wild eyes, but stood frozen, his spines flat to his scalp. He was half crouched, arm outstretched for the gas canister but making no further move towards it. He knew he was projecting the same thing he had sensed from the human – a wall of raw, incapacitating emotion. Only what he was feeling wasn’t anger.

It was fear.
