Tonight I wake up again, and the street is awake under grimy lampposts.

I know what I'm going to do, and I don't want to, but my body no longer belongs to me.

I reach for it effortlessly; its scent is all I need: sweat, fear, the salt of a life I no longer have.

I hold it with hands that don't recognize my fingers. The skin stretches beneath my palm.

At first I try to pull away, I try not to, but my jaw doesn't wait; my mouth acts before memory.

The first bite tears through skin, then flesh, a wet sound that resonates like ripped leather.

The blood explodes hot and sweet on my tongue; the taste brings back memories that aren't mine.

It screams. Its nails claw at my back, its head spins violently, and the cracking… the cracking is metallic, intimate, and smells of a broken promise. I start with my hands, with my lips, until my voice fades and only the sticky sound of flesh parting remains.

When I finish, the silence is a cold wash. The street smells of iron, and I want to vomit, and at the same time, I lean in to savor what saved me from loneliness.

I return to my hollow body, my fingers stained and my throat filled with burning memories.

I know that tomorrow someone will open the door and see me and take me away, like a sentence or an absolution.

But for now, in the twilight, I allow myself to smile as I wipe my hands on the sidewalk.
